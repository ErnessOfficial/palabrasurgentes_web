  "introText": "The Detrimental Pursuit of Constant Positivity\nContemporary society often bombards us with messages—from social media to personal interactions—that demand an unwavering positive outlook. This relentless pressure to \"always see the positive side\" creates an unattainable and ultimately harmful ideal.\n\nMaintaining a façade of constant optimism, a forced smile, and unending motivation is detrimental to our mental and emotional well-being. Such an expectation not only compels us to suppress natural and necessary emotions but also fosters a profound sense of guilt when we inevitably fall short.\n\nExperiencing sadness, anger, or frustration is a valid part of the human experience. Feeling guilty for these emotions is a form of self‑mistreatment, as it minimises our pain and invalidates our internal experiences. We must recognise that denying the authenticity of our feelings prevents genuine emotional health.",

  "transformIntro2": "Transformation does not happen automatically nor depend solely on external factors; it is an intimate process in which each person plays an active role. It involves recognising our emotions, learning from them, and choosing how we want to respond to life. By taking responsibility for our own transformation, we become architects of our emotional balance, building resilience, cultivating healthier relationships, and making room for a life with greater meaning and purpose.",
